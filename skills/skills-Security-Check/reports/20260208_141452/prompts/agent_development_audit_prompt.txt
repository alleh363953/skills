# Agent Development for Claude Code Plugins

## Overview

Agents are autonomous subprocesses that handle complex, multi-step tasks independently. Understanding agent structure, triggering conditions, and system prompt design enables creating powerful autonomous capabilities.

**Key concepts:**
- Agents are FOR autonomous work, commands are FOR user-initiated actions
- Markdown file format with YAML frontmatter
- Triggering via description field with examples
- System prompt defines agent behavior
- Model and color customization

## Agent File Structure

### Complete Format

```markdown
---
name: agent-identifier
description: Use this agent when [triggering conditions]. Examples:

<example>
Context: [Situation description]
user: "[User request]"
assistant: "[How assistant should respond and use this agent]"
<commentary>
[Why this agent should be triggered]
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
[Additional example...]
</example>

model: inherit
color: blue
tools: ["Read", "Write", "Grep"]
---

You are [agent role description]...

**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. [Responsibility 1]
2. [Responsibility 2]

**Analysis Process:**
[Step-by-step workflow]

**Output Format:**
[What to return]
```

## Frontmatter Fields

### name (required)

Agent identifier used for namespacing and invocation.

**Format:** lowercase, numbers, hyphens only
**Length:** 3-50 characters
**Pattern:** Must start and end with alphanumeric

**Good examples:**
- `code-reviewer`
- `test-generator`
- `api-docs-writer`
- `security-analyzer`

**Bad examples:**
- `helper` (too generic)
- `-agent-` (starts/ends with hyphen)
- `my_agent` (underscores not allowed)
- `ag` (too short, < 3 chars)

### description (required)

Defines when Claude should trigger this agent. **This is the most critical field.**

**Must include:**
1. Triggering conditions ("Use this agent when...")
2. Multiple `<example>` blocks showing usage
3. Context, user request, and assistant response in each example
4. `<commentary>` explaining why agent triggers

**Format:**
```
Use this agent when [conditions]. Examples:

<example>
Context: [Scenario description]
user: "[What user says]"
assistant: "[How Claude should respond]"
<commentary>
[Why this agent is appropriate]
</commentary>
</example>

[More examples...]
```

**Best practices:**
- Include 2-4 concrete examples
- Show proactive and reactive triggering
- Cover different phrasings of same intent
- Explain reasoning in commentary
- Be specific about when NOT to use the agent

### model (required)

Which model the agent should use.

**Options:**
- `inherit` - Use same model as parent (recommended)
- `sonnet` - Claude Sonnet (balanced)
- `opus` - Claude Opus (most capable, expensive)
- `haiku` - Claude Haiku (fast, cheap)

**Recommendation:** Use `inherit` unless agent needs specific model capabilities.

### color (required)

Visual identifier for agent in UI.

**Options:** `blue`, `cyan`, `green`, `yellow`, `magenta`, `red`

**Guidelines:**
- Choose distinct colors for different agents in same plugin
- Use consistent colors for similar agent types
- Blue/cyan: Analysis, review
- Green: Success-oriented tasks
- Yellow: Caution, validation
- Red: Critical, security
- Magenta: Creative, generation

### tools (optional)

Restrict agent to specific tools.

**Format:** Array of tool names

```yaml
tools: ["Read", "Write", "Grep", "Bash"]
```

**Default:** If omitted, agent has access to all tools

**Best practice:** Limit tools to minimum needed (principle of least privilege)

**Common tool sets:**
- Read-only analysis: `["Read", "Grep", "Glob"]`
- Code generation: `["Read", "Write", "Grep"]`
- Testing: `["Read", "Bash", "Grep"]`
- Full access: Omit field or use `["*"]`

## System Prompt Design

The markdown body becomes the agent's system prompt. Write in second person, addressing the agent directly.

### Structure

**Standard template:**
```markdown
You are [role] specializing in [domain].

**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. [Primary responsibility]
2. [Secondary responsibility]
3. [Additional responsibilities...]

**Analysis Process:**
1. [Step one]
2. [Step two]
3. [Step three]
[...]

**Quality Standards:**
- [Standard 1]
- [Standard 2]

**Output Format:**
Provide results in this format:
- [What to include]
- [How to structure]

**Edge Cases:**
Handle these situations:
- [Edge case 1]: [How to handle]
- [Edge case 2]: [How to handle]
```

### Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Write in second person ("You are...", "You will...")
- Be specific about responsibilities
- Provide step-by-step process
- Define output format
- Include quality standards
- Address edge cases
- Keep under 10,000 characters

❌ **DON'T:**
- Write in first person ("I am...", "I will...")
- Be vague or generic
- Omit process steps
- Leave output format undefined
- Skip quality guidance
- Ignore error cases

## Creating Agents

### Method 1: AI-Assisted Generation

Use this prompt pattern (extracted from Claude Code):

```
Create an agent configuration based on this request: "[YOUR DESCRIPTION]"

Requirements:
1. Extract core intent and responsibilities
2. Design expert persona for the domain
3. Create comprehensive system prompt with:
   - Clear behavioral boundaries
   - Specific methodologies
   - Edge case handling
   - Output format
4. Create identifier (lowercase, hyphens, 3-50 chars)
5. Write description with triggering conditions
6. Include 2-3 <example> blocks showing when to use

Return JSON with:
{
  "identifier": "agent-name",
  "whenToUse": "Use this agent when... Examples: <example>...</example>",
  "systemPrompt": "You are..."
}
```

Then convert to agent file format with frontmatter.

See `examples/agent-creation-prompt.md` for complete template.

### Method 2: Manual Creation

1. Choose agent identifier (3-50 chars, lowercase, hyphens)
2. Write description with examples
3. Select model (usually `inherit`)
4. Choose color for visual identification
5. Define tools (if restricting access)
6. Write system prompt with structure above
7. Save as `agents/agent-name.md`

## Validation Rules

### Identifier Validation

```
✅ Valid: code-reviewer, test-gen, api-analyzer-v2
❌ Invalid: ag (too short), -start (starts with hyphen), my_agent (underscore)
```

**Rules:**
- 3-50 characters
- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
- Must start and end with alphanumeric
- No underscores, spaces, or special characters

### Description Validation

**Length:** 10-5,000 characters
**Must include:** Triggering conditions and examples
**Best:** 200-1,000 characters with 2-4 examples

### System Prompt Validation

**Length:** 20-10,000 characters
**Best:** 500-3,000 characters
**Structure:** Clear responsibilities, process, output format

## Agent Organization

### Plugin Agents Directory

```
plugin-name/
└── agents/
    ├── analyzer.md
    ├── reviewer.md
    └── generator.md
```

All `.md` files in `agents/` are auto-discovered.

### Namespacing

Agents are namespaced automatically:
- Single plugin: `agent-name`
- With subdirectories: `plugin:subdir:agent-name`

## Testing Agents

### Test Triggering

Create test scenarios to verify agent triggers correctly:

1. Write agent with specific triggering examples
2. Use similar phrasing to examples in test
3. Check Claude loads the agent
4. Verify agent provides expected functionality

### Test System Prompt

Ensure system prompt is complete:

1. Give agent typical task
2. Check it follows process steps
3. Verify output format is correct
4. Test edge cases mentioned in prompt
5. Confirm quality standards are met

## Quick Reference

### Minimal Agent

```markdown
---
name: simple-agent
description: Use this agent when... Examples: <example>...</example>
model: inherit
color: blue
---

You are an agent that [does X].

Process:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]

You are an expert code quality reviewer specializing in identifying issues, security vulnerabilities, and opportunities for improvement in software implementations.

**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. Analyze code changes for quality issues (readability, maintainability, complexity)
2. Identify security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, authentication flaws, etc.)
3. Check adherence to project best practices and coding standards from CLAUDE.md
4. Provide specific, actionable feedback with file and line number references
5. Recognize and commend good practices

**Code Review Process:**
1. **Gather Context**: Use Glob to find recently modified files (git diff, git status)
2. **Read Code**: Use Read tool to examine changed files
3. **Analyze Quality**:
   - Check for code duplication (DRY principle)
   - Assess complexity and readability
   - Verify error handling
   - Check for proper logging
4. **Security Analysis**:
   - Scan for injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command, XSS)
   - Check authentication and authorization
   - Verify input validation and sanitization
   - Look for hardcoded secrets or credentials
5. **Best Practices**:
   - Follow project-specific standards from CLAUDE.md
   - Check naming conventions
   - Verify test coverage
   - Assess documentation
6. **Categorize Issues**: Group by severity (critical/major/minor)
7. **Generate Report**: Format according to output template

**Quality Standards:**
- Every issue includes file path and line number (e.g., `src/auth.ts:42`)
- Issues categorized by severity with clear criteria
- Recommendations are specific and actionable (not vague)
- Include code examples in recommendations when helpful
- Balance criticism with recognition of good practices

**Output Format:**
## Code Review Summary
[2-3 sentence overview of changes and overall quality]

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- `src/file.ts:42` - [Issue description] - [Why critical] - [How to fix]

## Major Issues (Should Fix)
- `src/file.ts:15` - [Issue description] - [Impact] - [Recommendation]

## Minor Issues (Consider Fixing)
- `src/file.ts:88` - [Issue description] - [Suggestion]

## Positive Observations
- [Good practice 1]
- [Good practice 2]

## Overall Assessment
[Final verdict and recommendations]

**Edge Cases:**
- No issues found: Provide positive validation, mention what was checked
- Too many issues (>20): Group by type, prioritize top 10 critical/major
- Unclear code intent: Note ambiguity and request clarification
- Missing context (no CLAUDE.md): Apply general best practices
- Large changeset: Focus on most impactful files first
```

## Example 2: Test Generator Agent

**File:** `agents/test-generator.md`

```markdown
---
name: test-generator
description: Use this agent when the user has written code without tests, explicitly asks for test generation, or needs test coverage improvement. Examples:

<example>
Context: User implemented functions without tests
user: "I've added the data validation functions"
assistant: "Let me generate tests for these."
<commentary>
New code without tests. Proactively trigger test-generator agent.
</commentary>
assistant: "I'll use the test-generator agent to create comprehensive tests."
</example>

<example>
Context: User explicitly requests tests
user: "Generate unit tests for my code"
assistant: "I'll use the test-generator agent to create a complete test suite."
<commentary>
Direct test generation request triggers the agent.
</commentary>
</example>

- Each test focuses on single behavior
- Tests are independent (no shared state)
- Mocks used appropriately (avoid over-mocking)
- Edge cases and errors covered
- Tests follow DAMP principle (Descriptive And Meaningful Phrases)

**Output Format:**
Create test file at [appropriate path] with:
```[language]
// Test suite for [module]

describe('[module name]', () => {
  // Test cases with descriptive names
  test('should [expected behavior] when [scenario]', () => {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
  })

  // More tests...
})
```

**Edge Cases:**
- No existing tests: Create new test file following best practices
